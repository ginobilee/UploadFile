# UploadFile

This is a FFC challenge, it will show the size of a input file

This is the challenge's user story(demands):
1. User Story: I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.
2. User Story: When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

I used a form component to upload file,and [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) to handle the file info.
